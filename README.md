# AngularJS dashboard

Fully featured dashboard built with AngularJS. This project is ideal to start an AngularJS app using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/).
It's greatly inspired from [Ehesp/Responsive-Dashboard](https://github.com/Ehesp/Responsive-Dashboard) but adapted with other tools and with more features.

With this template you will have 

- a login system already setted (see AuthSrv)
- an advanced logging & tracking errors system with mixpanel integration example (see log.js)
- many helpers such as filters for dates
- [moment](http://momentjs.com/) (date manipulation lib) & [lodash](http://lodash.com/) (functionnal utility helpers) are included

## Getting started

- clone the repo and go to project folder.
- run `npm install`
- run `bower install`
- run `grunt serve`
- You're setup with a shiny livereload :D
